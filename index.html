    <h2>Biography</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Josie Tamayo</b> (b. 2002 adiabatically compressed in the Southern California desert) is an undergaduate student at UCSB pursuing a major degree in Georaphy & a minor degree in Media, & Technology. I grew up in a small town in the Imperial Valley in a place called Calipatria, CA. My childhood interests began with culinary chemistry, evolving into other scientific realms such as Biology & Neuroscience. As my interests developed, I began fusing together knowledge of all that I've been interested in which has led to me courses in Environmental Studies, Geography, &, more currently, Media, Arts, & Design. Along with all of these interests, I've a curiosity on how technology can form a better understanding of these topics, myself, and the rest of the world.

    <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
    <p>
      The foundation of my art & design serve as a function of understanding myself & the world & how things function within the world. My curiosity lies within the intangible & the things the pass every day, but never care to notice. Creative technology is a major component of the media I produce & has been useful for me to unveil the artistic design of my curiousities. 
    </p>
    
The media I create often involves distortive mirroring techniques that uncover realms exhibiting symmetrical patterns, arching light patterns, & alien-like biota wuth recursive, colurful expression.
