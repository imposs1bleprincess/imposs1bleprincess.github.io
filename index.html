    <b>Josie Tamayo</b> (b. 2002 somewhere in the desert) is an undergaduate student at UCSB pursuing a major degree in Georaphy & a minor in Media, Arts, & Design. I grew up in a small town in the Imperial Valley in a place called Calipatria, CA. My childhood interests began with culinary chemistry, evolving into other scientific realms such as Biology & Neuroscience. As my interests developed, I began fusing together knowledge of all that I've been interested in which has led to me courses in Environmental Studies, Geography, &, more currently, Media, Arts, & Design. Along with all of these interests, I've a curiosity on how technology can form a better understanding of these topics, myself, and the rest of the world.
