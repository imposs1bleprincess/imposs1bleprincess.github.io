        <h1>Life Flows</h1>
        <p>
           Use of hybrid vertical & horizontal mirroring techniques to exhibit an <i>as above so below</i> composite. The photo collection process for <i>Life Flows</i> began at sunset while foraging for inspiration within the tall chapparal that encloses my apartment. Slithering its way into my view, I made a friend in a garden snake as I snapped photos of the horizon.

         <h1>Hyphaeic</h1> 
         <p>
          <i>Her nerves spread like wings at mycelium speed. Into the atmosphere, spores everywhere <br>- Bjork</i><br><br>
          Inspired by the ecological soundscapes of Bjork's <i>Fossora</i>, I grew an addiction for the early morning silence. <i>Hyphaeic</i> is an artwork embodying the ability to listen to nature's quiet and lush whispers. The undoctored image was captured on UCSB near Storke Tower & uses mirroring & dynamic blending techniques.

          <h1>Distant Relations</h1>
          <p>Geography taught me about Tobler's Law-- <i>that with distance, objects become less related to each other</i>. With this project, I wanted to exhibit an artistic representation of the inverse of what Tobler's Law states.

         <h1>Elements of Life</h1>
         <p>
          More photo-mirroring & extensive photo blending techniques with the intention of creating or <i>more so</i> unveiling alien-like plant life. I wanted to explore the possibilities of what plant life could look like on other planets while upholding its familiar presence.

          <h1>Biodata</h1>
          <p>This is a display of technology used in a biological data collection setup which incorporates an EEG and a hear-rate monitor that are connected to a lighting system. This setup was a component of a larger audio-visual project which used the biodata as a modulator for both audio & visuals created for the exhibit.</p>
